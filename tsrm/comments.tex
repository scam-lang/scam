\label{Comments}

Comments should be used both sparingly and effectively in code.
Scam allows for three kinds of comments:

\begin{description}
\item[file]
    all text in a file after the
    two character combination \verb!;$! is ignored.
\item[block]
    all text between the
    two character combinations \verb!;{! and \verb!;}! is ignored.
\item[line]
    all text on a line following the character \verb!;! is ignored.
\end{description}
