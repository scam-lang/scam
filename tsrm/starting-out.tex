\chapter{Starting Out}
\label{StartingOut}

A word of warning: if you require fancy graphically oriented development
environments, you will be sorely disappointed in the Scam Programming
Language. Scam is programming at its simplest: a prompt at which you type
in expressions which the Scam interpreter evaluates. Of course, you can
create Scam programs using your favorite text editor (mine is {\it vim}).
Scam can be used as a scripting language, as well.

\section{Running Scam}

In a terminal window, simply type the command:

\begin{verbatim}
    scam <fileName>
\end{verbatim}

where <fileName> is replaced by the name of the file contining your
Scam program ({\it i.e.} Scam source code).
You should be rewarded with the output from your Scam program.
At this point, you are ready to proceed to next chapter.
