\section{Scam}

Scam is a nifty little language
that looks a lot like Scheme, but is so much more.
Scam is:

\begin{itemize}
    \item
        an impure functional language with Scheme-like syntax
    \item
        a language where writing iterators like {\it while} and {\it for}
        is possible purely through function definition
    \item
        a language where everything is a function,
        including {\it define} and {\it set!}
        -- overloading these functions can be fun!
    \item
        a fully object-oriented language with trivial syntax and
        easy-to-comprehend semantics
    \item
        a language with programmer-controlled delayed
        evaluation
    \item
        a language with built-in garbage collection
    \item
        a language that optimizes tail-recurion
    \item
        a language that supports multi-threading
\end{itemize}

%Here is an experimental Microsoft Windows version: \xlink{scam.exe}{scam.exe}.
%You will also need \xlink{readline5.dll}{readline5.dll} and
%\xlink{history5.dll}{history5.dll}. Copy all three files to:
%
%\begin{verbatim}
%    c:\windows\system32
%\end{verbatim}
%
%and you should be good to go. You will need to run Scam in a DOS box (command
%prompt).

%If you want to use the set of Scam libraries (useful functions 
%written in Scam) but don't know how to set up a path on Windows, install the 
%\xlink{libraries}{lib/}
%in same directory as your program, if you want to use any of them.

\section*{Installation Notes}

To install Scam, perform the following steps
(using {\tt scam-2.0c-i386.tgz} as an example)...

\begin{enumerate}

\item
    Make a directory named {\it scam} that hangs off your home directory
    and then move into that directory

\begin{verbatim}
    mkdir ~/scam
    cd ~/scam
\end{verbatim}

\item
    Retrieve the tarball:

\begin{verbatim}
        wget beastie.cs.ua.edu/scam/scam-2.0c-i386.tgz
\end{verbatim}

    Mac users may need to use \verb!curl -O! instead of \verb!wget!.

\item
    Extract the files in the tarball:

\begin{verbatim}
    tar xvzf scam-2.0c-i386.tgz
\end{verbatim}

\item
    copy the {\it scam} executable to a directory in your path:

\begin{verbatim}
    cp scam ~/bin                # if you have your own bin
\end{verbatim}

or you can put \verb!~/scam! in your path.
If you don't know what a path is, then do this instead:

\begin{verbatim}
    sudo cp scam /usr/local/bin
\end{verbatim}

\end{enumerate}

\section*{Learning more about Scam}

There is an Open Source
reference manual that delves into Scam in detail.
It is called 
\xlink
    {The Scam Reference Manual}
    {http://beastie.cs.ua.edu/scam/tsrm}

The reference manual gives the nuts and bolts on the syntax
and semantics of Scam.
